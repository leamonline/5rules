        description: "When someone really gets under your skin, they might be showing you something about yourself you haven't fully accepted yet.",
        introduction: [
            "We all have parts of ourselves we've pushed away or tried to hide—maybe because we were told they weren't acceptable, or they felt too uncomfortable.",
            "Interestingly, these hidden parts often show up in how we react to others. That person who really annoys you? They might be reflecting something you do too, or wish you could do.",
            "This isn't about blame—it's about curiosity. By exploring what triggers you, you can reclaim parts of yourself you've lost touch with."

        description: "When your emotions feel bigger than the situation, there's usually a deeper reason. Let's trace it back together.",
        introduction: [
            "Have you ever reacted to something small like it was a big deal? Maybe someone cancelled plans and you felt devastated, or a tiny mistake felt like the end of the world.",
            "These \"overreactions\" aren't random—they're connected to older feelings and experiences from your past.",
            "By gently asking \"why does this bother me?\" a few times, you can discover what's really going on underneath."

        description: "You don't have to be just one thing. Being \"organised\" doesn't mean you can't also handle chaos when it comes.",
        introduction: [
            "We often define ourselves in fixed ways: \"I'm the responsible one,\" \"I'm the calm one,\" \"I'm the strong one.\"",
            "But these rigid labels can become prisons. What happens when you're NOT calm? Does that mean you've failed?",
            "Real strength comes from flexibility—knowing you can be organised AND handle messiness, be kind AND set firm boundaries."

        description: "Many of the rules you live by came from other people. It's worth checking which ones you actually want to keep.",
        introduction: [
            "Growing up, we absorb countless \"shoulds\" from parents, teachers, culture, and society: \"Always work hard,\" \"Don't show weakness,\" \"Put others first.\"",
            "Some of these serve us well. Others might be outdated or were never right for us in the first place.",
            "This exercise helps you sort through your values and consciously choose which to keep, which to adopt as your own, and which to let go."

        introduction: [
            "Something happens: plans get cancelled. Then our mind kicks in: \"This ALWAYS happens to me,\" \"The universe hates me,\" \"My whole day is ruined.\"",
            "The event itself was neutral—just plans changing. But the story we tell creates extra suffering.",
            "By separating fact from story, we can respond to what's actually happening instead of reacting to our narratives about it."
        ],
        explanation: "Events are just events. The meaning we add is optional. This gives you back choice."
