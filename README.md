# The 5 Rules Workbook

The 5 Rules Workbook is a guided React app for working through five reflective exercises inspired by the book **The 5 Rules**. It walks you through each exercise with clear prompts, a calming breathing prelude, and automatic journey saving so you can pause and resume anytime.

## What the app does

- **Guided journey storage:** Your answers are saved locally as you type, and past journeys can be archived for reference. Progress automatically resumes where you left off.
- **Five focused exercises:** Each rule has its own flow:
  - Understanding what triggers you
  - Tracing your reactions
  - Embracing all of you
  - Choosing your own values
  - Separating facts from stories
- **Breathing prelude:** Before starting an exercise, a short breathing practice helps you settle in; you can also skip it if you prefer.
- **Summaries and exports:** Review a completed journey, spot recurring themes, and export reflections as text.
- **Onboarding and resets:** A brief onboarding explains the flow, and you can reset or start a fresh journey at any time.
